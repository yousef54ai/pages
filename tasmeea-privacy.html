<h1>Privacy Policy - Tasmeea</h1>

<p>Last updated: 2025/9/6</p>

<hr>

<h2>Data Collection</h2>
<p>Tasmeea does <strong>not collect, store, or process any user data</strong>. We do not have servers or databases that store your information.</p>

<h2>How the App Works</h2>
<p>Tasmeea requires microphone access to provide Quran recitation verification:</p>

<pre>
- Your voice is sent directly from your device to Google's Speech Recognition services
- We do not intercept, store, or process your audio data
- The speech recognition happens entirely between your device and Google's servers
- Google returns the text result directly to your device
- All recitation verification happens locally on your device
</pre>

<h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>The app communicates exclusively with Google Speech Recognition services. We do not communicate with any other external servers or services:</p>

<pre>
- Audio data flows directly from your device to Google's Speech Recognition API
- Google's privacy policy governs how they handle your speech data
- We have no access to or control over Google's data processing
</pre>

<h2>Local Data</h2>
<pre>
- All Quran text is stored locally on your device (no internet required)
- Your recitation progress is saved locally on your device only
- No data is transmitted to our servers because we don't have any
</pre>

<h2>Data Security</h2>
<p>Since we do not collect, store, or process any user data, there is no user data at risk. All data remains on your device or is handled directly by Google's services according to their security practices.</p>

<h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
<p>Our app is suitable for all ages. Since we do not collect any personal information, there are no additional privacy concerns for children using this app.</p>

<h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>We may update this privacy policy periodically. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated revision date.</p>
